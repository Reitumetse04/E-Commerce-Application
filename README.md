The "ThreadAndDaringStore API" is an ASP.NET Core Web API designed for managing an online clothing store. It supports features like product catalog management (CRUD), user registration and login with JWT authentication, role-based access (admin and customer), shopping cart functionality, order processing, and filtering and sorting of products. The backend uses Entity Framework Core with a PostgreSQL database (hosted locally or via Neon.tech).Developers can interact with the API through Postman for testing and documentation. To get started, clone the repository, set up the database connection in `appsettings.json`, apply migrations, and run the project. Key contributors include Reitumetse04 (core API and features), Lokusa (user login), and reneuwephoku (payments API).
