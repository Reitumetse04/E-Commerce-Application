The "ThreadAndDaringStore" API is an ASP.NET Core Web API built to power an online storeâ€™s product catalog and shopping cart system. It allows for product listing and management (CRUD), as well as shopping cart operations like adding, removing, and clearing items. The API is built with Entity Framework Core and uses a PostgreSQL database (hosted locally or via Neon.tech). Postman is used to test and interact with the endpoints. To get started, developers can clone the repository, configure the database connection in the appsettings.json file, apply migrations to create the database schema, and run the project locally. This project was developed collaboratively, with contributions from Reitumetse04 (core features and architecture), Lokusa, and reneuwephoku.
